# specish.github.io

Specish is a small test framework based on ES6 modules.

- No need to transpile your ESM-based project
  (unlike other frameworks based on CommonJS)
- Use familiar function like `describe`, `it`, `expect`, `beforeEach`
- Runs in the browser or Node.js

> Specish requires support for ES6 modules.
> Fortunately most modern browsers support ES6 modules.
> The latest version of Node.js has experimental support
> which can be enabled by adding `"type": "module"`
> in your `package.json` file.

### TO DO

- finish test coverage
- consider renaming Specish.js to specish.js
