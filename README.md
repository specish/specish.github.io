Specish is an ES6 modules test framework
that allows your tests to coexist with your code.

Most JavaScript test frameworks are based on CommonJS.
Specish is based on ES6 modules instead.

## Advantages of using an ES6 modules test framework

- No need to transpile just because your code uses ES6 modules.
- Put your tests in the same module as your code.
- Run your tests in the browser or Node.js.

> Please note that support for ES6 modules is required
> for running tests with Specish.
> Fortunately, most modern browsers support ES6 modules.
> The latest version of Node.js has experimental support
> for ES6 modules.
